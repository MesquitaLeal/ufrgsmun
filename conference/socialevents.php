                        <p>The first social event of UFRGSMUN 2014 is going to be a happy hour in a pub for getting to know other delegates over drinks or beers (alcohol-free options are also available of course). Great music and ambiance to talk and enjoy the first moments of UFRGSMUN!</p>

                        <p>Committee Dinners</p>
                        <p>With the purpose of better introducing and integrating the delegates of a same committee, there will be committee dinners for the first time in UFRGSMUN! This format of social event, popular at MUNs in other corners of the world, allows inner-committee interaction in a non-formal manner. The proposition is that each committee gets a different cozy bar/restaurant near the location of the Talent Show, where you will get to know better your committee’s staff and delegates from other universities.</p>

                        <p>Talent Show</p>
                        <p>After dinner, delegates and UFRGSMUNS’s staff go straight to display thir hidden skills at our Talent Show. Delegates and delegations may perform on stage anything they would like to show other delegates: singing, dancing, reciting, stand-up comedy and others. Everybody – talented or not – is highly encouraged to share particular skills. This night will definitely be remarkably enjoyable and funny!</p>

                        <p>After hosting FIFA World Cup, Porto Alegre will now see the city’s ultimate annual sports event: UFRGSMUN’s Soccer Cup! Delegates, women and men, are encouraged to make teams and play for the title of UFRGSMUN’s soccer champion! We are also going to have a gaucho style barbecue (a.k.a, the true barbecue). Everybody is expected to devour one of the best meals that Rio Grande do Sul can provide (vegetarians, don’t worry, there will also be meat-free options!).</p>

                        <p>UFRGSMUN’s last evening will be anything but sad. A great get-together of delegates and staff to celebrate new friendships, the resolutions that were approved (or merrily complain about the ones the were not) and UFRGSMUN itself. UFRGSMUN 2014 may then be coming to an end, but the joy that it will have brought will be at its apex at this party!</p>
