            <h5>Disarmament and International Security Committee</h5>
            <p>
                The Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC), also known as the First Committee, is one of the six main committees of the United Nations General Assembly. It addresses disarmament and international security matters in the light of the general principles of cooperation to the maintenance of international peace and security, in order to prevent the disruption of armed conflict and the heightening of tensions in the international system. Since the past decade, the committee has been focusing on issues of nuclear non-proliferation, small arms illicit traffic and regional militarization.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly, the DISEC is entitled to present its recommendations over the issues under its consideration to a plenary meeting of the Assembly, usually in the form of draft resolutions and decisions. Through this mechanism, the First Committee has been the primary origin of legal initiatives that led to important international treaties and conventions, such as the Treaty of Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1968 and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1996.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each Member State of the United Nations is represented by one delegate in this committee and decisions on draft resolutions and recommendations are approved on a two-thirds majority basis, turning the DISEC into a broad and inclusive platform for the debate of pertinent issues concerning the maintenance of international peace and security.

        <h6>Topic A<br/>Foreign Military Bases</h6>
        <p>
            The establishment of foreign military bases is a key matter to understand the distribution of power in spheres of influence throughout the world. Oversea bases are the first mechanism of a mass network which works to maintain the control exercised by great powers, becoming the infrastructure for wars.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of military power to access another country’s soil is not a modern practice. It dates to the old Greece and its city-states (Harvaky 1989). In the 15th century, in the context of the maritime empires’ expansion and their dispute for discovered territories, basing access became crucial to defend new lands and to serve as trading posts, securing vital interests of great powers such as the Iberian Monarchies and the British Empire (Harvaky 1989). Nevertheless, it was from the 20th century onwards, with the two Great Wars and the consequently ascension of the USA and the USSR as superpowers, that the establishment of oversea military bases has assumed the configuration we are known to today.
        </p>
        <p>
            Foreign military bases became the most important apparatus of organizations as NATO and European Union. The use of this tool when it is related to interventions is currently justified by great powers as a protective measure in territories in conflict or in territories where governments are considered dangerous for its own population (Zeijden 2009). However, it is possible to draw a link between the foreign presence abroad and the possibility of overthrowing governments on the battle ground.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the 9/11 episode, the establishment of oversea military posts has increased and turned into a key dimension of US foreign policy against the War on Terror. According to the Defense Department’s annual “Base Structure Report”, from 2013, the US have about 600 military installations abroad, distributed over allied countries as United Kingdom, Israel and Japan and also over non-partners countries, such as Cuba and Afghanistan. According to Wilbert van der Zeijden (2009), from the Transnational Institute,
        </p>
        <p class="citation"><em>
            (…) many of the 300 overseas military interventions and invasions of the US in the past century, like Korean War, Vietnam War and Gulf War, were only possible because the US had well-positioned military facilities to launch and support these military operations.
        </em></p>
        <p>
            The current developments regarding Ukraine, Russia and Crimea reinforce the strategic importance of foreign military bases. Through the Agreement between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on the Status and Conditions of the Russian Federation Black Sea Fleet’s Stay on Ukrainian Territory, Russia has the authority to locate troops on its bases in Crimea, and to move them between those bases and Russian territory (Posner 2014). However, such presence could represent a threat to Ukraine’s sovereignty in case of conflicts: the recent events exemplify these worries as well as the strategic role of maintaining overseas bases. Sebastopol, the city where Russian naval forces were historically located with Ukraine’s permissions is now declared a legitimate Russian territory, reinforcing questions about the establishment of foreign military bases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides security issues, another quarrel that must be tackled related to the establishment of military bases abroad is the concept of sovereignty. The Status of Force Agreement (SOFA) is the main accord responsible for regulating the presence of oversea military bases. It is signed by a host country and a foreign nation and provides the rights and the privileges of foreign military people who turn exempt from local laws (Mason 2012). However, this agreement and the continued presence of foreign bases itself are considered by many as a violation of sovereignty, being just a mechanism to project power over strategic regions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Foreign military resources installed in another’s soil are usually linked to air stations, navy bases or army bases. Some of these military posts are test ranges for new weaponry or are related to intelligence programs, as Echelon, being important signal receivers. Through these facilities, overseabases are consolidated into great powers’ foreign policy, being an integral part in many regional conflicts or an economic and political support to allied governments (Zeijden 2009).
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, the establishment of foreign military bases is a complex and paradoxical issue which involves many concepts and interests. Are the great powers really protecting other countries? From who are they supposed to be defending their allies from? This way, we invite all DISEC delegates to join us and discuss this important matter in order to answer these questions and find the best solution for this controversial practice.

        <h6>Topic B<br/>Airspace Stabilization and Disarmament: <br/>The Issue of Military RPAS in Foreign Airspace</h6>
        <p>
            Ever since the astonishing technological advances on aviation took place after the events of World War One and World War Two and there was a subsequent growing occupation of the skies, the previously unexplored task of administrating the airspace above all countries became a necessity for States and the international community. Efforts towards some sort of regulation started with the Paris Convention of 1919, when it was established that each State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory - land and sea. In 1944, the Chicago Convention took these efforts even further and established a binding document still utilized in contemporaneity, which among its many articles, created the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO 2014a).
        </p>
        <p>
            The Convention was held from the general recognition of the importance of safeguarding international commerce and the free transit of peoples by air, factors indispensable for economic and political prosperity. Furthermore, ICAO’s members were also given the task of ensuring safe transit in international airspace, which was done by categorizing what constitutes a threat to a State’s national security. Such measures were vital during the Cold War, when the skies were viewed with suspicion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, the Convention made sure to appoint airspace regulation as a direct matter of sovereignty (Erotokritou 2012). The State was to be the sole responsible for guaranteeing a stable environment for civil aviation. Article 6 of the Convention stated that a foreign civil aircraft was only allowed to fly above national territory when there existed formal agreements between the two involved States. However, sovereignty brought other issues into question. It meant that any unresolved matters that took place in land or the sea were transferred to the sky as well, as the case of border skirmishes. This is the case of recent political issues between China and Japan and the air defense zones established over disputed islands in the East China Sea (The Economist 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
            When flights are carried out by States, however, the Convention exempts itself from the responsibility of regularization - as expressed on Article 3(a) -, due to the largely controversial nature of air traffic by national police forces or the military on foreign territory. Furthermore, there is still no delimitation between airspace and outer space, which has a completely separate international legislation. Such facts points to the outdated state of current airspace regularization apparatuses (Erotokritou 2012).
        </p>
            At the present moment, the situation is even more complex. The current international reality presents irregular warfare throughout many continents as well as growing sophisticated technological developments in security gadgets. This contributed to the development of the unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), more specifically, the remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) - popularly designated as drones. While RAPS can be largely beneficial for specific military actions, it also has political-economical disadvantages, even aside from the Human Rights spectrum. Skies occupied by drones can greatly jeopardize a country’s international commerce and the transit of people, having direct negative impacts on its population.
        </p>
        <p>
            ICAO is already working towards the establishment of a regulatory framework through Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) for the utilization of UAS for civil purposes (ICAO 2011b). It attempts to expand Article 8 of the Chicago Convention, which states that no pilotless aircraft can enter foreign airspace without the express authorization by foreign authorities. So far, it has brought good results regarding the civil issue. However, the utilization of RPAS for military action remains unresolved.
        </p>
            Delegates are invited to address the task of guaranteeing peace and stability in the skies, having in mind all the damages that continuous military actions employed by drones can cause to a State’s economy and, subsequently, to its society. Therefore, Member States in DISEC must find a way to conciliate both the security and commercial needs of all delegations, while discussing the uttermost importance of a demilitarized sky.
