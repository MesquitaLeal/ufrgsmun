            <h5>WORLD ENERGY COUNCIL</h5>
            <p>
                The World Energy Council (WEC) is the UN-accredited global energy body, and it is the principal impartial forum of leaders aiming at the development of an affordable and sustainable energy system. It is based in London and it supports intergovernmental organizations, governments and companies in achieving that goal. The WEC brings together all of the world’s economic areas, every kind of organization and every kind of energy ranging, from renewable to fossil fuels. Its network is currently made up of more than 3,000 organizations in over 90 countries from its six main regions: Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America & Caribbean, Middle East and North America.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since its creation in 1923, the WEC has gone through several changes to adapt in a world where the way people understand and use energy is constantly changing. Every year, it informs global, regional and national energy strategies and trends by hosting events (such as the World Energy Congress), publishing studies and facilitating the dialogue about world’s energies policies. The Council has a key role to play in the energy scene, and it uses its wide network of members, its collective knowledge and its influence to help the world towards a sustainable energy future. In this XII UFRGSMUN, will be simulated the Ministerial Meeting, which brings together government representatives from all member countries.

        <h6>Topic A<br/>Shale Gas: Revolution?</h6>
        <p>
            The beginning of this century has testified a big change on the energy sector: the so-called “Shale Gas Revolution”. Shale gas is, along with tight natural gas and coalbed methane, one of the unconventional gases whose production has become economically viable due to technological advances on extraction and the energy commodities’ high prices. Its exploration occurs mainly in the United States of America and Canada, but reserves are found in South America, Australia, Africa and East Asia. This alternative energy source already responds to more than 20% percent of the natural gas production in the US, with a projection to achieve almost a half by 2035. China, though, is believed to be the country with the largest shale gas reserves.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are, nonetheless, many doubts on what will be the effects of the Shale Gas Revolution. It may reduce the dependence of many countries on the import of energy, reshaping the geopolitical game. Its production through hydro fracturing is surrounded by concerns about the environmental viability, from methane leakages to the contamination of groundwater by the chemicals used in the process. Environmentalists fear that unconventional gas becomes a substitute not for coal, but for renewable energy resources. Some experts point that instead of a revolution, shale gas will be just a short term alternative, as productivity tends to drop sharply after the first years of extraction. Notwithstanding, it is an activity mostly unregulated or few regulated worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
            The debate, which is predominantly national, has a lot to be enriched by multilateralism. Through sharing its views, practices and knowledge, the delegates will be able to set an international guide of recommendations on shale gas production. The World Energy Council calls upon all representatives to address the many points involving the issue. Energy security, social and economic impacts and, specially, environmental viability have to be considered and debated to assure the safe, responsible and sustainable use of this energy resource.

        <h6>Topic B<br/>Energy Transition and Challenges for the XXI Century</h6>
        <p>
            At the 1970s, the energy model based on oil unveiled for the first time its structural limits. The current energy matrix, supported by geologically determined and relatively scarce finite fossil fuel resources, has showed its first signs of exhaustion with the oil crises of 1973 and 1979 (Yergin 1993). At that time, it became evident that the world could not continue to generate sustained economic growth by expanding the consumption of finite fossil fuels, at least not at the pace that had been undertaken during the 1940s – 1960s. Gradually, the need to establish a transition to the "post-oil era" became even clearer. The most likely scenario would apparently involve the establishment of a "transition model", based on the view that it would be necessary, in a first step, to overcome the current energy model dependence on finite resources. It would allow the structuring of a new energy model which facilitates the generation of virtually infinite energy, greatly reducing economic, social and environmental costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the increase in oil prices in the 2000s, this debate has been resumed, partly by new environmental pressures, but also due to the limitations presented by the ruling energy model, essentially sustained by finite fuels like oil, coal and natural mineral gas or nuclear energy. This energy model based on finite resources has clear limitations to allow the expansion of production and consumption for the entire world population at affordable prices and with reduced environmental and social impacts. In this sense, the dominant model contributes to the maintenance of existing inequalities between nations, especially given the control exercised by the great powers over the production and distribution of energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The concept of Energy Transition can be understood as a set of structural changes in the form of converting, producing, transmitting, storing and consuming energy. These technological and production changes are intrinsically related to changes in the energy matrix of transport, communications and production of material goods. Thus, they affect reproduction and capital accumulation, social and work relationships and also political institutional demands for the states. These transformations depend on technological innovations in basically five categories: (I) the development of new engines, generators or other systems of energy generation (thermal, mechanical or electrical) for industrial activities, transportation or production and consumption of electricity; (II) new fuels or new ways to utilize the nature resources; (III) new transmission systems of energy (thermal, mechanical or electrical); (IV) new techniques for energy storage; and (V) new uses and new ways of consuming energy (Oliveira 2012).
        </p>
        <p>
            However, relevant challenges related to the different stages of a large Energy Transition can significantly increase the likelihood of conflicts in the twenty-first century, marked by disputes between the different energy security strategies of the great powers, especially whether they dispute the last large reserves of oil and gas (Martins 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
            This way, countries and energy companies face the following problem: how to expand the duration of the existing energy matrix, which implies the use of relatively scarce fuels, unequally distributed geographically and also costly and highly polluting? The expected solution for the discussion would undertake a great energy transition, with recommendations for building a new energy matrix, cleaner, supported by the most abundant sources, less polluting and less costly, which in the long run are virtually endless. The main proposals nowadays are those who advocate for the construction of an energy matrix centered on hydrogen, biofuels, in a specific range of renewable energies (solar, wind) or nuclear energy.
