                <h5>International Court of Justice</h5>
                <p>
                    The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is the oldest and principal judicial organ of the United Nations. It was created through the UN Charter, in 1945, as part of the system of peaceful settlement of disputes. Its work as a replacer of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) began in 1945, and its Statute is very much alike its predecessor’s at the League of Nations. The first case of the ICJ Docket was the Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania), submitted on 22 May 1947, and, since then, almost 150 cases were received by the Court. The number of cases brought before the Court is increasing rapidly since the 1980’s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This judicial body’s functions are (1) to settle international disputes of a legal content brought by States (Contentious Jurisdiction of the Court) and (2) to give opinions on juridical matters raised by UN organs and specialized agencies (Jurisdiction to provide Advisory Opinions). The proceeding adopted by the Court includes a written and an oral stage, both public, and, once the latter is completed, the judges deliberate in closed chambers. ICJ’s decisions are final and cannot be appealed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are fifteen standing judges elected in a Charter-based process for nine-year terms. Judges are elected on the basis of their notorious knowledge of the law, not their nationality, and, unlike diplomats, they shall not represent their governments. The voting procedure for their election is strict, and demands a majority of votes both in the United Nations General Assembly and in the Security Council. The aforementioned elections occur every three years for one third of the seats (five judges), and re-elections are allowed. There cannot be more than one judge elected of each nationality. When a Contentious Case is brought before the Court, if there are no standing judges of the parties’ nationality, they may request an ad hoc judge of their choice.

        <h6>Topic A<br/>Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia)</h6>
        <p>
            On 2 July 1999, Croatia filed proceedings before the ICJ against the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (now Serbia) for violations of the 1948 Genocide Convention. The Applicant contended that Yugoslavia was liable for “ethnic cleansing” in the Croatian regions of Slavonia and Dalmatia during the 1991-1995 Croatian War of Independence, as well as for directing and encouraging Croatian citizens of Serb ethnicity in the Knin region to evacuate the area.
        </p>
        <p>
            Accordingly, Croatia requested the Court to adjudge and declare that Yugoslavia breached its legal obligations to Croatia under the Genocide Convention and that it had an obligation to pay compensation for damages to Croatia.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the case review progressed, the Respondent submitted preliminary objections to the Court that led to the suspension of the proceedings on the merits of the case. On 18 November 2008, the Court rendered its judgment on the preliminary objections raised by the Respondent, finding that it had jurisdiction over the case.
        </p>
        <p>
            On 4 January 2010, Serbia filed its counter-claims against Croatia for the extermination, expulsion and forced religious conversions of large numbers of Serbs before and during World War II, as well as over the murders of Serbs who tried to return to their homes when the war ended, and the more recent murders of Serbs in the Croatian War of Independence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Court is therefore invited to discuss, firstly, whether Serbia has violated its obligations to Croatia under the 1948 Genocide Convention and, if so, to determine the applicable means of compensation and, secondly, whether Croatia has infringed its own obligations to Serbia under the aforementioned treaty and, if so, to establish the due forms of reparation.

        <h6>Topic B<br/>Obligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean <br/>(Bolivia v. Chile) </h6>
        <p>
            During the 19th century, Bolivia and Chile got involved in a war known as War of the Pacific – one of the most decisive conflicts waged in South America. The war’s outcome was the Chilean annexation of a valuable disputed territory on the Pacific coast, which former belonged to Bolivia.
        </p>
        <p>
            The War of the Pacific started on 14 February 1879. Chilean military forces invaded and occupied the Bolivian port of Antofagasta, after Bolivia had increased taxes and tried to confiscate properties of Chilean companies who were mining nitrates at its territory. After the invasion, Bolivia declared war to Chile. The conflict took place over five years and it was ended on 4 April 1884, through the signing of a Truce Pact.

        </p>
        <p>
            As a result of being on the losing the war, Bolivia also lost its coastline to Chile and became a landlocked nation. Bolivia has never accepted this lost and, since that time, has claimed a right to the coast. The country’s attempts to recover a fully sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean started in early 20th century.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bolivia and Chile entered into direct negotiations regarding an agreement over Bolivian claims in June 1950. Although there are statements of high Chilean officials declaring the willing to dialogue, negotiations remained unfruitful. Therefore, Bolivia decided to bring its dispute with Chile to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on 24 April 2013.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Bolivian claim submitted to the ICJ has one legal ground: Chile has committed itself through agreement, diplomatic practice and statements of its highest-level representatives to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia.
        </p>
        <p>
            In its application, Bolivia requests the ICJ to adjudge and declare (a) that Chile has the obligation to negotiate with Bolivia in order to reach an agreement granting Bolivia a fully sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean; (b) that Chile has violated this obligations and (c) that Chile must perform the obligation in good faith, promptly, formally, effectively and within a reasonable time. In this sense, the ICJ judges must decide if Chile is bound by international law to enter into negotiations regarding Bolivia’s fully sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean and, if so, whether it has failed to fulfill such obligation.
