            <h5>United Nations Security Council</h5>
            <p>
                The UN Security Council is the primary body of the United Nations for maintaining international peace and security. One of the main characteristics of the UNSC, which contrasts with other UN organs, is that it is the only committee whose resolutions are binding upon all member states, regardless if they are current members of the UNSC or not. Moreover, it is also in the Council’s mandate the right to authorize the use of force through peacekeeping operations or military coalitions and also to impose economic and military sanctions, but always as a last resort when all negotiations have failed (especially in the case of military action). Therefore, the UNSC’s first actions when a complaint related to a threat to international peace and security is brought before it is to recommend to the parties to try and reach a peaceful solution. It may also help ceasing of the dispute by investigating or mediating the conflict. The Council has also ordered ceasefires and imposed economic sanctions or collective military embargoes on many occasions in which disputes have led to the use of force. At last, the UNSC may recommend the suspension or expulsion, by the General Assembly, of a Member State that recurrently violates the principles of the UN Charter. This committee is, then, essential for maintaining international peace and security and saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war—the main goal of the United Nations—, while its relevance goes way beyond security and geopolitics, because its decision have effects on the populations directly involved in the conflicts it strives to solve.
            </p>
            <p>
                The UNSC is formed by fifteen members, of which five are permanent and ten are selected by the General Assembly for two year terms. The five permanent members of the Security Council are China, France, Russian Federation, United Kingdom and United States, and they hold what is commonly known as “veto power”. That means that for any resolution to be approved it needs the concurring vote of the five “great powers”, meaning that if they are against, it will automatically fail. Current temporary members of the UNSC are Argentina, Australia, Chad, Chile, Jordan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Nigeria, Republic of Korea, Rwanda.

        <h6>Topic A<br/>The situation regarding non-State military actors in the Middle East</h6>
        <p>
            The 21st century has seen an increase in the number of actions against the so-called non-State military actors. Even though there is no such thing as an universally accepted definition on these groups, some features are commonly adopted when dealing with this issue: an organized group with, at least, a basic structure of command; its operations happening outside state control; the use of force to achieve political objectives; the irregularity of its military actions, in opposition to the most common military doctrines of regular armies; among others (KIRAS, 2013; DCAF; 2011). Usually, common groups that turn into non-state military actors are rebel cells that challenge a State, non-internationally recognized representative entities and terrorist organizations, but they also may be troops from private military companies, for example.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Middle East, by its turn, is not only an important region due to its geopolitical relevance – located in the crossroads of three continents and owning huge amounts of oil and natural gas –, but also for all the recent conflicts in order at such place. During the first decade of the 21st century, the US and some Western and regional allies have triggered a couple of wars against Al-Qaeda and States in the region supposedly linked to it in order to dismantle the so-called terrorist menace – which, in fact, after all, still persists (ROLLINS, 2011; CHALIAND and BLIN, 2007; MAHER and NEUMANN, 2012). Although these wars are still impacting the region, and also the whole world, other non-state military actors that are not commonly connected to terrorism have been involved in important conflicts, such as Hezbollah and Hamas against the State of Israel, being also polemic for its connection with States like Iran, which tend to view them as legitimate representatives of resistance movements (SKEZELY, 2012; GAUB, 2013; HIRST, 2010; GERGES, 2010; SCHANZER, 2013). There was also the development of a growing presence of private military companies fighting those wars in the Middle East (FERREIRA, 2008; NASCIMENTO, 2010; BERNDTSSON, 2009). Therefore, this region of the world, nowadays, is home of maybe the most important and internationally well-know non-state military actors of our time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The UNSC, as guarantor of international security and peace, must address such pressing and polemic issue. This topic is relevant not only due to the high polarization that it involves – since one side tends to see all these groups as radical and terrorist actors at the same time that the other side claims the importance to differentiate between all kinds of such groups – but also by the fact that the UN must evaluate all the efforts that it have been taking in regard to non-State military actors, especially after this whole decade of conflicts involving the Middle East and these groups, also updating its approach to them in such region, laying frameworks that must be used when dealing with this type of actors from now on.

        <h6>Topic B<br/>The Situation in Iraq</h6>
        <p>
            Since the U.S. intervention in 2003, passing through the official withdrawal of troops in 2011 and reaching the current situation, Iraq struggles to reconcile its various religious and ethnic groups in order to rebuild itself (Halliday, 2004; Visentini 2012; Knights, 2013). The Civil War in 2006 (officially ended in 2008) marked the climax of the sectarian crisis between Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. It is well known that a divided and weak Iraq fits many foreign interests, as well as the complete elimination of the Baas and its political influence (Visentini 2012). This facilitates foreign capital entry in the country, as well as their immediate departure together with national wealth. In this fragmentation context, and in addition to the Civil War, the majority Shiite faction, led by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, remains in power due to strong repression policies against the Sunnis (who historically had the political power) or due to agreements yielding political autonomy to the Kurds in the north (Khoury 2014; Lebel 2014; Johnson 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
            However, although it has been relatively successful in maintaining this situation for a few years, the Iraqi government sees itself increasingly unable to contain the now reinvigorated Sunni opposition due to the situation in Syria and its spillover in almost every way in Iraq - ideology, personal and material (Khoury 2014). In this context, a key actor for the future of Iraq are the sunni militants of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria). ISIS is an affiliated al-Qaeda group, which represents the most destabilizing factor in the country today. The group policy mimics that of Al-Qaeda: hatred of foreign troops in the country, as well as the Shiites in power, in addition ISIS aims the creation of a Sunni caliphate encompassing Iraq and Syria (Meldensohn 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
            Accordingly, with fuel supplied by the Syrian crisis, ISIS has been growing impressively: the group has already taken whole cities (only last month were Ramadi and Falluja) (Meldensohn, 2014). In response, the repression has been tough, taken directly by the Iraqi Army and, together with the exclusion of Sunnis from the important positions in the government, can escalate quickly to another Civil War (Knights 2013; Lobe 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
            All this considered, it is of great importance that the UNSC looks carefully on the Situation in Iraq: how to isolate Iraq from the tension in Syria and avoid a new civil war, now enhanced by the Sunni supranational link? How the problem of sectarianism can be mitigated? Does a stabilized and strong Iraq interests to the major powers? These and other questions should be put on the table, since the topic is of high relevance for the international relations of Middle East and its future.
