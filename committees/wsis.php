                <h5>Ministerial Round Table of the World Summit on the Information Society Forum 2014</h5>
                <p>
                    The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) Forum is the combination of many WSIS-related events that took place since 2005. WSIS was a United Nations (UN) summit which created a multi-stakeholder platform aimed at addressing the issues raised by information and communication technologies (ICTs). WSIS’s main goal was to “achieve a common vision, desire and commitment to build a people-centric, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society where everyone can create, access, utilize and share information” (ITU, 2012).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The UN General Assembly Resolution 56/183 (21 December 2001) endorsed the holding of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in two phases. The first phase took place in Geneva (2003) and the second one in Tunis (2005). Since then, a cluster of WSIS-related events was held on an annual basis. In 2009, all of the WSIS-related events were rebranded as WSIS Forum. WSIS Forum is organized each year, hosted by the ITU and co-organized by ITU, UNESCO, UNCTAD and UNDP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The WSIS Forum discusses many topics related to the Information Society, such as: ICT affordability, broadband for sustainable development, creation of local content, ICT infrastructure development, capacity building, including e-learning and investment in education, fostering of the innovation, ICT entrepreneurship and software development at national and regional level, preservation of culture and ecology, ensuring good governance and wellbeing of all people, accessibility, cloud computing, cybersecurity, spam, ICT policy and regulatory frameworks.

        <h6>Topic A<br/>Internet Government Surveillance </h6>
        <p>
            In face of the rapidly changing nature of communication and exchange of information in the 21st century, the effective protection of human rights, such as the right to privacy, finds itself in a delicate position. At the same time that this unprecedented democratization of information can benefit civil society, it can also culminate in unparalleled exposure when used by powerful agents such as ICT enterprises and the State itself. Recent episodes of unwarranted and arbitrary government and private surveillance on civilians – most notably the Snowden case – have sparked a debate about what the limits are on access to online personal data of citizens and interventions on their private communications. Notable organizations, such as Human Rights Watch and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, as well United Nations organs such as the Human Rights Council, have gravely addressed the subject in the passing year, pointing to the dangers these practices inflict mainly (but not solely) on the fundamental rights to privacy and freedom of expression (HRW 2014; Rodriguez 2013; UNGA 2013), therefore jeopardizing the foundations of democratic societies (UNGA 2013, 21).
        </p>
        <p>
            In this context, a series of questions and concerns are raised about the future of access and collection of personal online data by private and public institutions. Most signatories of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, for example, have legal provisions that protect correspondence and telecommunication from violation, but most have not adapted to the overwhelming substitution of these by internet communication (HRW 2014). Thus, often making it impossible for States and enterprises to be held accountable for privacy violations on the internet. Moreover, if further regulation is established to protect online data, yet another discussion is raised: what is the adequate justification for data and communication interception? The notion of “national security” is often used by government bodies not only to intercept unregulated internet communication, but to justify violations of privacy otherwise prohibited by law (UNGA 2013). How far into civilians' information are States allowed to go for the sake of national security? What types of data collection and communication interventions are acceptable under which specific threats to national security? And under what circumstances is it reasonable for enterprises and governments to look into and keep data for long periods of time on the basis of suspicion?
        </p>
        <p>
        	Coming times of blazing technology are urging the international community to find new standards in social indemnity and human rights protection in the virtual world as well as in the physical one. The same tool that is responsible for major democratic achievements may be threatening some of the founding principles of democracy itself (Richards 2013). States, therefore, must come together in an effort to improve and even rebuild the guidelines for the protection of privacy and freedom of speech in this new era of communication.

        <h6>Topic B<br/>Legal and Political Measures to address Cybercrime</h6>
        <p>
            Cybercrime, in a narrow sense, comprises any illegal behavior directed by means of electronic operations that target the security of computer systems and the data processed by them. Thus, the term “cybercrime” is narrower than computer-related crimes, once it has to involve a computer network (ITU, 2012, p. 12). With internet proliferation in the past couple of decades, making it safer and protecting its users have become essential to the development of new services and government policies. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) continue to be exploited by malevolent users, becoming intrinsically linked to organized crime on the Internet.  According to ITU, “vulnerabilities in software applications are purposely sought out in order to create malware that will enable unauthorized access and modification, thus compromising integrity, authenticity and confidentiality of the ICT networks and systems” (ITU, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a shared international responsibility that calls for coordinated action related to prevention, preparation, response and recovery from incidents on the part of government authorities, the private sector and citizens, entailing international cooperation with relevant partners. Cybersecurity strategies, such as the development of technical protection systems or the education of users to prevent them from becoming victims of cybercrime, can help to reduce the risk of cybercrime (ITU, 2012, p. 2-3).
        </p>
        <p>
            Countries still have to adopt further appropriate legislation against the misuse of ICTs for criminal or other purposes and against activities intended to affect the integrity of national critical infrastructures. The fight against cybercrime covers a broad range of activities in security from network attacks, theft or denial of service, theft of identity, eavesdropping, telebiometrics for authentication, security for emergency telecommunications and telecommunication network security requirements (ITU, 2012, p.2; GROENFELDT, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
            Governments and the private sector have been working together in order to address cybercrime by considering legislation that allows for effective investigation and prosecution of misuse. It is widely recognized that the fight against cybercrime needs a comprehensive approach. Technical measures are not deemed satisfactory to prevent any crime, urging law-enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute cybercrime effectively. It requires substantive criminal law provisions to criminalize acts such as computer fraud, illegal access, data interference, copyright violations and child pornography (ITU, 2012, p. 3-5). Even though provisions applicable to similar acts outside the network do exist in criminal codes, it does not mean that they can be applied to acts committed over the Internet as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cybercrime investigations present a series of challenges. “Perpetrators can act from nearly any location in the world and take measures to mask their identity. The tools and instruments needed to investigate cybercrime can be quite different from those used to investigate ordinary crimes” (ITU, 2012, p. 3). Besides, many cybercrimes usually have an international dimension, like e-mails with illegal content that pass through a number of countries during the transfer from sender to recipient, or illegal content that is stored outside the country. Within cybercrime investigations, close cooperation between the countries involved is very important (ITU, 2014; ITU, 2012, p.3-4). The abovementioned adversities and challenges call up the need for WSIS ministers to adopt measures to prevent, respond and recover from cybercrime.
